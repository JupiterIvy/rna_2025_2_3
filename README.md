## CBIS-DDSM Dataset with Efficient Net V2 M x Resnet 152

This project aims to mitigate a binary classification problem in the healthcare field, specifically regarding the prediction of benign or malignant tumors identified in mammograms.

To this end, a case study was conducted comparing two influential classification models: EfficientNetV2 and Resnet152.

The objective of the study was to compare both models and perform the necessary treatments, such as the use of a hyperparameter optimizer, Optuna, the use of stratified cross-validation, and the preprocessing of the target dataset.

In this repository, you will find the notebooks used to test both models separately.
